This page will deal with the question of how to grade fairly while maintaining rigor.

## The Challenge

You want to:

- Evaluate *technical* skill fairly (Part 1 & 2)
- Encourage *honest theological reflection* without requiring a particular belief (Part 3)
- Not punish students who are new to thinking theologically

## The Solution

**For Parts 1 & 2 (Technical):** Grade these like any rigorous CS assignment. The rubric is clear: Is the analysis correct? Is the optimization real? Does the code work?

**For Part 3 (Reflection):** Grade based on:

- **Engagement:** Does the student seriously engage with the texts and concepts, not blow them off?
- **Connection:** Do the theological ideas connect specifically to *their* algorithm, or are they generic?
- **Honesty:** Is there evidence of real thinking, or just "right answers"?
- **Depth:** Do they acknowledge complexity, trade-offs, questions they don't have answers to?

**What NOT to grade on:**

- Whether the student agrees with Christian theology
- Whether they reached a "correct" conclusion about stewardship
- Whether they write beautifully (though clarity helps)

**Example:** A student writes: "I realized I never thought about whether an algorithm was efficient. I just wanted it to work. Now I see stewardship means I should think about resources. But I also wonderâ€”if I'm working for a company that doesn't care about this, what's my responsibility? I don't know." 

**Grade:** This is A-level reflection. It's honest, it engages the theology, it acknowledges complexity. You want more of this.
