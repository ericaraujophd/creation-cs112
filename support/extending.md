## For Advanced Students

:::{admonition} Option 1: Historical Investigation
:class: dropdown
:icon: false

"Choose a real-world system (Google's search algorithm, Facebook's news feed, Uber's dispatch system) that is known to have efficiency issues or to have prioritized something other than computational efficiency. Research: Why did the engineers make the choices they did? What pressures were they under? What would a stewardship-informed redesign look like?"

:::{admonition} Option 2: Ethics Case Study
:class: dropdown
:icon: false

"Some argue that making systems *too* efficient can harm workers (e.g., warehouse robots that replace humans, automated systems that eliminate jobs). Research and reflect: Can efficiency and justice ever be in tension? How would you balance them?"
:::

:::{admonition} Option 3: System Design from Scratch
:class: dropdown
:icon: false

"Design a new system (a data structure, a caching strategy, a database schema) from first principles with stewardship in mind. What would change about how you design it if resource conservation was a primary goal from the start, not an afterthought?"

## For Struggling Students

:::{admonition} Option 1: Simplified Reflection
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Provide a scaffolded reflection template:

- "I discovered that [inefficiency] by [method]"
- "This matters because [resource impact]"
- "From a stewardship perspective, this means [principle]"
- "I will [action] going forward"
:::

:::{admonition} Option 2: Discussion-Based Reflection
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Instead of writing 2-3 pages, have a one-on-one or small-group discussion about the assignment. Let them think out loud.
:::

:::{admonition} Option 3: Paired Work
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Let students work in pairs: one writes the technical part, one leads the reflection (though both contribute).
