Use these before, during, or after the assignment:

## Before (To Set Up the Question)

**"Think about a system you use regularly (Instagram, Google, your university's email). Do you think the engineers who built it were thinking about stewardship? How can you tell?"**

Expected answers: Some mention privacy concerns, speed, tracking, etc. The point is to make students realize: *Design choices are visible. They reveal what the designer valued.*

**"If you were redesigning that system with stewardship in mind, what would you change?"**

This helps them see that stewardship isn't abstract—it leads to concrete design changes.

## During (To Deepen the Reflection)

**"You optimized this algorithm, and it's now faster. But the optimized version is harder to read. Should you keep it? What factors matter in deciding?"**

This is the real question. Optimize for *what*, exactly? Execution speed? Readability? Energy efficiency? Deployment ease? These are value questions.

**"What if you discovered that the inefficient algorithm was written by someone who was under intense time pressure and just wanted to ship something that worked? Does that change how you think about it?"**

This is about judgment and grace. Stewardship doesn't mean harsh condemnation of everyone who didn't optimize. But it does mean awareness and intention going forward.

**"Many AI/ML systems are extraordinarily compute-intensive. Some researchers argue that's worth it because the benefits (better medicine, better translation, etc.) outweigh the cost. Do you agree? How would you decide?"**

This introduces genuine moral complexity. Not everything is a simple "optimize!" or "don't optimize!" decision.

## After (To Connect to Professional Identity)

**"How will this assignment change how you think about your work as a computer scientist or engineer?"**

Listen for: Increased awareness, intention, a sense of responsibility. These are signs the assignment worked.

**"When you're in industry, what would need to be true for you to push back against shipping an inefficient system?"**

This is about virtue formation—helping students imagine themselves as people of integrity in their future work.
