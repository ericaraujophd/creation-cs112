:::{admonition} "Students are just going through the motions on the reflection"
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Try: Emphasize in your introduction that the reflection is a core part of the assignment, not an add-on. Share examples of good reflections (anonymously, with permission) to set the standard. During office hours, ask probing questions: "What surprised you in your optimization? How does that connect to stewardship?" Push them to think beyond "I made it faster."

:::{admonition} "The theological content feels disconnected from the algorithm stuff"
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Try: When students bring their work to office hours, ask: "Show me exactly where in your optimization process stewardship mattered. What would you have done differently without thinking about stewardship?" Make the connection concrete and specific.
:::

:::{admonition} "Some students are really uncomfortable with the theology"
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Try: Acknowledge it in class. "I know this might feel unfamiliar. You don't have to agree with it to engage with it. Just give it serious thought." Consider offering an alternative reflection that uses secular ethical frameworks (utilitarianism, virtue ethics, etc.) instead.
:::

:::{admonition} "Students are writing longer reflections, not better ones"
:class: dropdown
:icon: false
Try: Explicitly say that length doesn't correlate with quality. Have an example of a short, excellent reflection alongside a longer, mediocre one. Show the difference.
