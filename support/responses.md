## Response 1: "Optimization Isn't My Job—The Hardware Is Fast Enough"

**What students mean:** "Why should I worry about efficiency when computers are so powerful? This feels like premature optimization."

**How to address it:**

**In the moment:** "That's actually a really common view, especially after the 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' aphorism became popular. But here's the thing: optimizing an algorithm often isn't about doing extra work. It's about *recognizing structure* and avoiding unnecessary work in the first place."

**Deeper response:** "Also, think about scale. Yes, your laptop is fast. But if your algorithm runs on a data center serving millions of users, or on mobile devices with limited batteries, or in an embedded system where power consumption matters, then efficiency isn't optional—it's responsible design."

**Theological angle:** "From a creation perspective, we don't get to assume resources are infinite just because they're abundant. Abundance is a gift, but a gift doesn't authorize us to waste. A gardener doesn't assume water is unlimited just because rain falls."

## Response 2: "In the Real World, We Don't Have Time for This. We Ship First, Optimize Later"

**What students mean:** "Time-to-market matters more than perfection. This is idealistic."

**How to address it:**

**Acknowledge the tension:** "You're right that there's real pressure in industry to move fast. And sometimes good-enough is actually good enough. But that's different from never thinking about it."

**Reframe:** "Here's what I think you should develop as a habit: When you're designing a solution, spend *just a little bit* of time asking: 'Is there a structure to this problem I'm not seeing? Is there a smarter way?' Often, the optimized solution is just as easy to implement as the naive one—you just have to think about it first."

**Real-world example:** "Netflix engineers optimize their systems meticulously because they understand: if our system uses 10% less energy per query, across 200 million users, that's millions of dollars saved and thousands of tons of CO₂ not emitted. That's not just virtue—it's business sense."

**Theological angle:** "And more importantly, you're a steward. That doesn't mean perfectionism paralysis, but it does mean *intentionality*. When you make a choice to ship an inefficient system, you should be doing that consciously, not just because you didn't think about it."

## Response 3: "This Is Mixing Religion and Computer Science. They're Separate Domains"

**What students mean:** "I don't like theology bleeding into tech. They have nothing to do with each other."

**How to address it:**

**Calmly:** "I understand the impulse to keep domains separate. But here's the thing: You can't keep them separate. Every system you design embodies values and assumptions about the world. The question isn't whether theology influences technology—it's whether it influences it *consciously* or *unconsciously*."

**Examples:**

- "If you design a social media algorithm to maximize engagement, you're making a theological claim: that human flourishing is achieved through more engagement. Is that true? Worth asking."
- "If you extract as much data as possible from users to train a model, you're making a claim about who owns that data and what matters. Is it?"
- "If you optimize for speed at the expense of privacy, you're choosing speed over human dignity. That's a values choice."

**Non-preachy angle:** "Look, you don't have to agree with Christian theology to see this. Secular ethicists are asking the same questions: What are we building? For whom? What values does it reflect? This assignment is just *one* framework for asking those questions. It's the Christian framework because this is a Christian university, but the underlying point—that you should think about values in design—is pretty universal."

## Response 4: "I Optimized My Algorithm, but the Reflection Questions Are Too Vague"

**What students mean:** "I don't know what theological answer you're looking for. What's the 'right' answer?"

**How to address it:**

**This is actually good.** It means they're being thoughtful. Encourage it:

"Great question. And it's important: I'm *not* looking for a particular theological conclusion. I'm looking for *honest engagement* with the questions. Here's what matters:

1. You've actually read and thought about the theology provided
2. You're connecting those ideas specifically to your algorithm—not speaking in generalities
3. You're thinking critically about the tensions (e.g., 'optimization is good, but what if it requires less readable code?')
4. You're being honest about your own choices and assumptions

An A-level reflection might say: 'I didn't think about stewardship when I chose my first algorithm. Now I see how I can design more responsibly. But I also realize that in industry, I might have to make trade-offs. Here's how I'd think about those trade-offs...'

A lower-level reflection would be: 'Optimization is important because resources are finite and stewardship is important and that's good.'"
