## Framing the Assignment (First Class)

Let's start by setting the stage for students. When you introduce this assignment, it's crucial to connect the technical work of optimization with the theological themes of creation and stewardship.

In order to hook students into the conversation, start with this core question:

> **"Am I designing and deploying these systems as a steward of God's creation, or am I complicit in extraction, exploitation, or disorder?"**

This isn't a soft question. It's the kind of question that should make a computer scientist pause and think carefully about their work. Use it to open the conversation:

**In Class:**

- Write the question on the board.
- Don't explain it yet. Ask students: "When you build a system, what does this question make you wonder about?"
- Let them respond. You'll likely hear answers related to: Who uses it? How much energy does it use? Is it for profit or purpose? Does it help people or manipulate them?
- Then say: "Today we're going to ground this question in a specific technical practice: optimization. And we're going to connect it to Christian theology about creation and stewardship."

## Why This Matters?

Many students see computer science as "neutral" or "technical"â€”separate from ethics and theology. This assignment challenges that assumption head-on. Key points:

1. **Every design choice reflects values.** There are no neutral systems. When you choose an inefficient algorithm, you're saying something about your values. You're saying: "These wasted resources don't matter to me," or "Speed-to-market matters more than impact," or "I didn't think about it."

2. **Stewardship is not optional for believers.** If students claim Christian faith, they can't compartmentalize their work into "secular" and "sacred" categories. Their technical practice is a form of discipleship.

3. **This isn't just about the environment.** Stewardship applies to all resources, including computational resources. When a system wastes energy, it has real impacts: higher costs for users, larger carbon footprints, devices that become obsolete faster, and exclusion of people with limited bandwidth.
