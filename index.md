## Introduction

This project contains a comprehensive learning experience that connects Christian creation theology to computer science, with a focus on algorithm optimization and stewardship. This is part of the training provided by the [De Vries Institute for Global Faculty Development](https://calvin.edu/de-vries-institute).

This assignment was developed with the assistance of Copilot and Claude LLM systems, under the guidance of Eric Araujo, to ensure theological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness. The whole content was guided and reviewed in order to align with Christian teachings and academic standards. AI assisted this project in drafting, organizing, and refining the materials, but all theological claims and educational strategies were overseen by the creator (with lower 'c').

## Contents

This project is organized into four main sections[^1]:

[^1]: It might be strange to some that I start counting at 0. Welcome to computer science!

### 0. Orientation

In this section you will find:

- A quick-start guide for instructors
- A summary of what makes this assignment effective
- Suggestions for adapting to different courses and student populations
- Key theological texts referenced

### 1. Assignment

The complete student assignment (3 parts):

- **Part 1:** Analyze an inefficient algorithm
- **Part 2:** Design and implement an optimized version  
- **Part 3:** Theological reflection on stewardship and design

This is what students will see. It includes:

- Full theological grounding from course materials
- Clear assignment objectives and checklist
- Grading rubric
- Suggested algorithms to analyze
- Discussion prompts for class conversation

**How to use:**

- Distribute to students at the start of the unit
- Use as-is, or adapt to your course/semester

### 2. Teaching Notes

Under the **Support** section you will find a detailed facilitation guide for instructors:

- How to frame the assignment in the first class
- Suggested 30-45 minute walkthrough lesson
- Common student responses and how to address them
- Discussion prompts (before, during, after)
- Grading guidance (especially for the theological reflection)
- Ways to extend for advanced students or support struggling ones
- Troubleshooting tips
- Tone guidance and faculty reflection prompts

**How to use:**

- Read this before teaching the assignment
- Use the walkthrough lesson in your first class
- Reference during grading for philosophical consistency
- Use discussion prompts throughout the unit

### 3. A Theology-to-CS Translation Guide

Under the **Translation** section you will find a quick reference translating theological concepts into CS language:

- 6 key theological concepts → CS practice mappings
- Concrete examples for each
- Decision framework for students to use while designing
- Glossary of theology-to-CS parallels
- Application to each CS course (Algorithms, Databases, Modeling)
- Common misunderstandings to avoid

**How to use:**

- Share with students as a study guide/handout
- Reference during discussion and office hours
- Keep as a bookmark for your own thinking

## Core Message to Students

Through this work, students should understand:

> Your technical choices aren't neutral. Every algorithm, every design decision, reflects values about what matters. As a Christian engineer or computer scientist, you're called to ask: Am I designing as a steward of God's creation, or am I complicit in extraction and waste? That's not a soft question. It's foundational to how you should think about your work.

## For Questions or Customization

Feel free to adapt these materials to your context:

- Change algorithm examples to match your course
- Adjust theological depth based on your students' backgrounds
- Add specific examples from your industry/domain
- Extend or simplify as your course needs

The core structure—technical rigor + theological reflection + real-world connection—remains the same.

## Success Indicators

You'll know this assignment is working when students:

1. **In analysis**: Understand *why* an algorithm is inefficient, not just *that* it is
2. **In optimization**: Can articulate the pattern/structure they discovered
3. **In reflection**: Ask genuinely about their responsibility, not just provide "right answers"
4. **In class**: Reference stewardship or the core question when discussing design choices
5. **Beyond this course**: Consider efficiency and responsibility in other technical work

Enjoy! This is deep, challenging work. Your students will remember these conversations.
