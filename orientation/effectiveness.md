This assignment works because it:

1. **Grounded in Core Theology** - The reflection isn't arbitrary; it comes directly from creation doctrine, stewardship concepts, and biblical teaching on human responsibility in the texts from your project

2. **Technically Rigorous** - Parts 1 & 2 are genuine CS work (analysis, optimization, implementation). The theology isn't a distraction; it deepens the technical thinking

3. **Integrative** - It helps students see their faith and their craft as integrated, not compartmentalized

4. **Skill-Building** - Students develop real habits: asking about resource usage, understanding problem structure, making intentional design choices

5. **Honest About Complexity** - It acknowledges real tensions (time-to-market vs. stewardship, optimization vs. readability, perfectionism vs. intention)
