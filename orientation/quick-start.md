## For Your First Class

1. Read the "Framing the Assignment (First Class)" section of Teaching Notes section
2. Use the "Suggested In-Class Walkthrough" to introduce the concept
3. Distribute the Assignment to students

## For Ongoing Teaching

- Use discussion prompts from Teaching Notes throughout the unit
- Reference the Translation Guide when students ask questions like "How does this connect?"
- Refer to "Common Student Responses" when you hear pushback
- Use the Grading Rubric as you evaluate assignments

## For Office Hours

- Help students understand their algorithm is a "choice" with theological implications
- Use the decision framework from Translation_Guide to help them articulate their design choices
- If they're struggling with reflection: use guided questions rather than providing answers
