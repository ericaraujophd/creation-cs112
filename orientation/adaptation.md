This assignment is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different course contexts and student populations. Below are some suggestions on how to modify the assignment while maintaining its core theological and educational objectives.

## For Different Courses

Some examples of how to adapt the assignment for various computer science domains:

**Databases:**

- Focus on query optimization and the impact of inefficient queries
- Discuss resource consumption of full table scans vs. indexed queries
- Consider inclusion/exclusion of users based on system speed

**Computational Modeling:**

- Focus on model complexity vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Discuss carbon footprint of large models
- Consider: Is a simpler model better stewardship?

**Any Course:**

- Adapt the "suggested algorithms" list to what you teach
- Adjust reflection questions to your domain
- Keep the core question: "Am I designing as a steward or extractor?"

## For Different Student Populations

**Non-Christian Students:**

- Frame as "ethical frameworks for technology design"
- Offer secular alternative ethical frameworks (utilitarianism, virtue ethics) for reflection
- The core ideas (accountability, wisdom, responsibility) are philosophically sound across worldviews

**Advanced Students:**

- See "Ways to Extend the Assignment" in the [Teaching Notes]()
- Push toward systemic thinking (how do your choices affect others at scale?)
- Explore real-world case studies

**Struggling Students:**

- Simplify the reflection with scaffolded templates
- Make reflection discussion-based instead of written
- Focus on the technical parts (analysis + optimization) with lighter theology load
