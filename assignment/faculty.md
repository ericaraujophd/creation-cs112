This assignment integrates three elements:

1. **Technical Skill Development:** Students practice analyzing algorithms, calculating complexity, and designing optimizations—core CS competencies.

2. **Theological Literacy:** Students engage seriously with creation doctrine, stewardship, and the ethics of technological power. They learn that these are not separate from "technical" concerns but foundational to how we think about technology.

3. **Vocational Reflection:** Students begin to see themselves as agents with moral responsibility in their technical work. The question "Am I designing as a steward or as an extractor?" becomes a touchstone for their professional identity.

**Tips for Implementation:**

- **Start in class:** Have students analyze a simple inefficient algorithm together before assigning individual work. Model the reflection questions.

- **Provide examples:** Showing one complete example (inefficient algorithm → analysis → optimization → reflection) helps students understand expectations.

- **Emphasize honesty in reflection:** Students may initially give "right answers" about stewardship without real engagement. Create space for genuine wrestling with questions. A honest "I wasn't thinking about this before" is better than superficial reflection.

- **Connect to future courses:** Reference this assignment in later courses when you encounter algorithms with real-world impact (databases at scale, machine learning, distributed systems). Help students see stewardship as ongoing.

- **Adapt for different courses:**
  - **Databases:** Focus on query optimization and how inefficient queries waste energy and exclude users with slow connections
  - **Computational Modeling:** Focus on model efficiency, unnecessary computational complexity, and what simplified models can teach us
  - **Data Structures:** Use this as a through-line: each data structure choice reflects stewardship values
