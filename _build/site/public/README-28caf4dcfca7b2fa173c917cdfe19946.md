## Wisdom in Optimization

This project contains a comprehensive learning experience that connects Christian creation theology to computer science, with a focus on algorithm optimization and stewardship. This is part of the training provided by the [De Vries Institute for Global Faculty Development](https://calvin.edu/de-vries-institute).

This assignment was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT-4, under the guidance of Eric Araujo, to ensure theological accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness. The whole content was guided and 

## Contents

### 1. **Wisdom_in_Optimization_Assignment.md**

The complete student assignment (3 parts):

- **Part 1:** Analyze an inefficient algorithm
- **Part 2:** Design and implement an optimized version  
- **Part 3:** Theological reflection on stewardship and design

This is what students will see. It includes:

- Full theological grounding from course materials
- Clear assignment objectives and checklist
- Grading rubric
- Suggested algorithms to analyze
- Discussion prompts for class conversation

**How to use:**

- Distribute to students at the start of the unit
- Use as-is, or adapt to your course/semester

### 2. **Teaching_Notes_Wisdom_in_Optimization.md**

Detailed facilitation guide for instructors:

- How to frame the assignment in the first class
- Suggested 30-45 minute walkthrough lesson
- Common student responses and how to address them
- Discussion prompts (before, during, after)
- Grading guidance (especially for the theological reflection)
- Ways to extend for advanced students or support struggling ones
- Troubleshooting tips
- Tone guidance and faculty reflection prompts

**How to use:**

- Read this before teaching the assignment
- Use the walkthrough lesson in your first class
- Reference during grading for philosophical consistency
- Use discussion prompts throughout the unit

### 3. **Theology_CS_Translation_Guide.md**

Quick reference translating theological concepts into CS language:

- 6 key theological concepts → CS practice mappings
- Concrete examples for each
- Decision framework for students to use while designing
- Glossary of theology-to-CS parallels
- Application to each CS course (Algorithms, Databases, Modeling)
- Common misunderstandings to avoid

**How to use:**

- Share with students as a study guide/handout
- Reference during discussion and office hours
- Keep as a bookmark for your own thinking

## Quick Start

### For Your First Class

1. Read the "Framing the Assignment (First Class)" section of Teaching_Notes
2. Use the "Suggested In-Class Walkthrough" to introduce the concept
3. Distribute the Wisdom_in_Optimization_Assignment to students

### For Ongoing Teaching

- Use discussion prompts from Teaching_Notes throughout the unit
- Reference the Translation_Guide when students ask questions like "How does this connect?"
- Refer to "Common Student Responses" when you hear pushback
- Use the Grading Rubric as you evaluate assignments

### For Office Hours

- Help students understand their algorithm is a "choice" with theological implications
- Use the decision framework from Translation_Guide to help them articulate their design choices
- If they're struggling with reflection: use guided questions rather than providing answers

## What Makes This Effective

This assignment works because it:

1. **Grounded in Core Theology** - The reflection isn't arbitrary; it comes directly from creation doctrine, stewardship concepts, and biblical teaching on human responsibility in the texts from your project

2. **Technically Rigorous** - Parts 1 & 2 are genuine CS work (analysis, optimization, implementation). The theology isn't a distraction; it deepens the technical thinking

3. **Integrative** - It helps students see their faith and their craft as integrated, not compartmentalized

4. **Skill-Building** - Students develop real habits: asking about resource usage, understanding problem structure, making intentional design choices

5. **Honest About Complexity** - It acknowledges real tensions (time-to-market vs. stewardship, optimization vs. readability, perfectionism vs. intention)

---

## How to Adapt This

### For Different Courses

**Databases:**

- Focus on query optimization and the impact of inefficient queries
- Discuss resource consumption of full table scans vs. indexed queries
- Consider inclusion/exclusion of users based on system speed

**Computational Modeling:**

- Focus on model complexity vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Discuss carbon footprint of large models
- Consider: Is a simpler model better stewardship?

**Any Course:**

- Adapt the "suggested algorithms" list to what you teach
- Adjust reflection questions to your domain
- Keep the core question: "Am I designing as a steward or extractor?"

### For Different Student Populations

**Non-Christian Students:**

- Frame as "ethical frameworks for technology design"
- Offer secular alternative ethical frameworks (utilitarianism, virtue ethics) for reflection
- The core ideas (accountability, wisdom, responsibility) are philosophically sound across worldviews

**Advanced Students:**

- See "Ways to Extend the Assignment" in Teaching_Notes
- Push toward systemic thinking (how do your choices affect others at scale?)
- Explore real-world case studies

**Struggling Students:**

- Simplify the reflection with scaffolded templates
- Make reflection discussion-based instead of written
- Focus on the technical parts (analysis + optimization) with lighter theology load

## Key Theological Texts Referenced

This assignment draws from the course project materials:

- **Creation Faith and Responsibility** (Pobee) - on gardening vs. mining, stewardship, dominion as limited authority
- **Creation and Economics** (Lim) - on technology, responsibility to moral order, stewardship
- **Intro to Christian Theology** - systematic creation doctrine, God's sovereignty, human limitation
- **The Triune Creator** (Gunton) - ethical dimensions of creation doctrine
- **Psalm 104** - celebration of God's wisdom in creation's design

All theological claims in the assignment are grounded in these texts. You can cite them directly when students ask "where does this come from?"

---

## Core Message to Students

Through this work, students should understand:

> "Your technical choices aren't neutral. Every algorithm, every design decision, reflects values about what matters. As a Christian engineer, you're called to ask: Am I designing as a steward of God's creation, or am I complicit in extraction and waste? That's not a soft question. It's foundational to how you should think about your work."

---

## For Questions or Customization

Feel free to adapt these materials to your context:

- Change algorithm examples to match your course
- Adjust theological depth based on your students' backgrounds
- Add specific examples from your industry/domain
- Extend or simplify as your course needs

The core structure—technical rigor + theological reflection + real-world connection—remains the same.

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know this assignment is working when students:

1. **In analysis**: Understand *why* an algorithm is inefficient, not just *that* it is
2. **In optimization**: Can articulate the pattern/structure they discovered
3. **In reflection**: Ask genuinely about their responsibility, not just provide "right answers"
4. **In class**: Reference stewardship or the core question when discussing design choices
5. **Beyond this course**: Consider efficiency and responsibility in other technical work

Enjoy! This is deep, challenging work. Your students will remember these conversations.
