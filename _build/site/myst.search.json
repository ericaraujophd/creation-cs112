This is not merely about environmental care; it extends to how we design and deploy all systems, including computational systems.\n\nKey Theological Principles:\n\n1. God Creates with Wisdom and Order“How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all” (Psalm 104:24). God designed the cosmos with intricate patterns, relationships, and efficiency. Creation itself reflects divine wisdom in how systems are organized and sustained.\n\n2. Humans Bear God’s Image and Share in His ResponsibilityHumans are made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26-28) and are called to “tend the garden” and “subdue the earth”—but the imagery is of a gardener, not a miner. A gardener must show “great sensitivity to resources available and the bounty of God.” Our authority is limited; we are stewards, not ultimate owners.\n\n3. All Authority is Exercised Under God’s AuthorityWhen humans rule over creation, they do so as delegated stewards under God’s sovereignty. We are “neither omniscient nor all-powerful” and “do not have power and freedom to perform at will.” Our power and creativity are circumscribed by responsibility.\n\n4. Creation is Ordered and GoodGod created a cosmos—a world system marked by order, beauty, and internal relationships held together by design. Each element has been assigned “its place and proper name” by the Creator. This ordering reflects God’s nature: “Whatever in creation manifests goodness, truth, and beauty is a pointer to and reflection of what its Creator God essentially and eternally is.”\n\n5. Technological Development Must Be Responsible“If creation is by the decisive will of God, then the use of the created order must take seriously the intention and will of God in creating the world. This means that technological and scientific invention and use must be responsible to the moral order.” We are accountable for how we design and deploy our technologies.","type":"content","url":"/wisdom-in-optimization-assignment#the-doctrine-of-creation-and-stewardship","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Wisdom in Optimization: A Learning Activity","lvl2":"The Problem: Inefficiency as a Form of Disorder"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/wisdom-in-optimization-assignment#the-problem-inefficiency-as-a-form-of-disorder","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Wisdom in Optimization: A Learning Activity","lvl2":"The Problem: Inefficiency as a Form of Disorder"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/wisdom-in-optimization-assignment#the-problem-inefficiency-as-a-form-of-disorder","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Wisdom in Optimization: A Learning Activity","lvl3":"What is Inefficiency?","lvl2":"The Problem: Inefficiency as a Form of Disorder"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/wisdom-in-optimization-assignment#what-is-inefficiency","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Wisdom in Optimization: A Learning Activity","lvl3":"What is Inefficiency?","lvl2":"The Problem: Inefficiency as a Form of Disorder"},"content":"In algorithms and systems, inefficiency means:\n\nWasted computational resources (CPU cycles, memory, bandwidth)\n\nUnnecessary complexity that obscures intent and increases maintenance burden\n\nMisaligned design with the actual problem structure\n\nExtraction of more from creation than is needed","type":"content","url":"/wisdom-in-optimization-assignment#what-is-inefficiency","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Wisdom in Optimization: A Learning Activity","lvl3":"Inefficiency as a Spiritual Problem","lvl2":"The Problem: Inefficiency as a Form of Disorder"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/wisdom-in-optimization-assignment#inefficiency-as-a-spiritual-problem","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Wisdom in Optimization: A Learning Activity","lvl3":"Inefficiency as a Spiritual Problem","lvl2":"The Problem: Inefficiency as a Form of Disorder"},"content":"From a creation perspective, inefficiency represents several failures:\n\nDisorder (Against God’s Creative Order)God created a cosmos—ordered and beautiful. An inefficient algorithm is chaotic in its relationship to the problem. It imposes unnecessary work on the system rather than discovering and reflecting the problem’s inherent structure.\n\nWaste (Against Stewardship)Stewardship means using resources wisely. An inefficient algorithm wastes computational resources—energy, processing power, memory—that could be used for other purposes or preserved. In a finite system, waste here means less available elsewhere.\n\nDisrespect for the Created Order (Against Recognition of Limits)An inefficient system treats computational resources as infinite. But they are finite. The same finiteness principle that limits extraction of natural resources also limits computational resources.\n\nFailure of Wisdom (Against Divine Pattern)Wisdom in creation means discovering and working with the inherent structure of things, not against it.

As you optimized the algorithm, what did you discover about the problem’s inherent structure? How is an optimized algorithm a form of “discovering” rather than “inventing”?\n\nQuestion 2: Stewardship and Resources\n\nThe doctrine of creation teaches that we are called to be stewards—“showing great sensitivity to resources available.” How many additional CPU cycles, memory, or energy does the inefficient algorithm waste compared to your optimized version? What does this waste represent, and why should we care?\n\nConsider: If this inefficient algorithm were used in a system deployed at scale (millions of devices, running continuously), what would be the cumulative impact? Who might be affected by that waste?\n\nQuestion 3: The Ethics of Power\n\nThe texts note that human authority over creation is “circumscribed” and that we are “neither omniscient nor all-powerful.” An inefficient algorithm often represents a kind of laziness—taking the easy approach rather than the wise approach. How does optimization represent a form of humility and responsibility?\n\nQuestion 4: Am I Designing Systems as a Steward or as an Extractor?\n\nReflect on this core question: “Am I designing and deploying these systems as a steward of God’s creation, or am I complicit in extraction, exploitation, or disorder?”\n\nConsider:\n\nCould the inefficient algorithm be acceptable in some contexts but not others?\n\nWhat if optimization required trade-offs (e.g., less readable code, more development time)?

You’re saying: “These wasted resources don’t matter to me,” or “Speed-to-market matters more than impact,” or “I didn’t think about it.”\n\nStewardship is not optional for believers. If students claim Christian faith, they can’t compartmentalize their work into “secular” and “sacred” categories. Their technical practice is a form of discipleship.\n\nThis isn’t just about the environment. Stewardship applies to all resources, including computational resources.

It’s about recognizing structure and avoiding unnecessary work in the first place.”\n\nDeeper response: “Also, think about scale. Yes, your laptop is fast. But if your algorithm runs on a data center serving millions of users, or on mobile devices with limited batteries, or in an embedded system where power consumption matters, then efficiency isn’t optional—it’s responsible design.”\n\nTheological angle: “From a creation perspective, we don’t get to assume resources are infinite just because they’re abundant.

But that’s different from never thinking about it.”\n\nReframe: “Here’s what I think you should develop as a habit: When you’re designing a solution, spend just a little bit of time asking: ‘Is there a structure to this problem I’m not seeing? Is there a smarter way?’ Often, the optimized solution is just as easy to implement as the naive one—you just have to think about it first.”\n\nReal-world example: “Netflix engineers optimize their systems meticulously because they understand: if our system uses 10% less energy per query, across 200 million users, that’s millions of dollars saved and thousands of tons of CO₂ not emitted. That’s not just virtue—it’s business sense.”\n\nTheological angle: “And more importantly, you’re a steward. That doesn’t mean perfectionism paralysis, but it does mean intentionality.
